Bowling Kata

This project originated when a coworker introduced me to the concept of a coding "kata" (http://www.peterprovost.org/blog/2012/05/02/kata-the-only-way-to-learn-tdd), 
the idea that you should spend 30 mins a day practicing and honing your programming skills. I chose to do the Bowling Kata, and while I don't necessarily work on it 
every day, I do work on it in bits and pieces, test driving bits and pieces when I get the chance. Once I think I have a working solution, or close enough, I'll 
start writing IT's to test end to end correctness. 

The basic idea of the Bowling Kata is simply to accept input around a game of bowling (i.e. pins knocked down) and then calculated the score given standard bowling
rules (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowling). I've tried to structure my objects in a reuseable and maliable way, to alter the structure if I want to tweek it down 
the road. For example, I've tried to avoid magic numbers around any pin calculations, in case there's a need for some super cool bonus round with 50 pins (have you 
ever played Wii bowling? They totally do it). I'm hoping that by the time this kata is over, I end up with maintainable, clear code that anyone could come along 
and use.
